# TrajectoryRoutingDemo

The demo is shown in  2019 IEEE 38th Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS). The link of the demo paper is here: [A Testbed for Data Routing in Low-Power WSNs using DV-Hop Based Trajectory Encoding Algorithm](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libproxy.mst.edu/document/9049569)
The current working demo is here: http://routing-demos.com:8080/
